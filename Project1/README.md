# AVAX-Intermediate-Module-1

This is the first project in AVAX-Intermediate, in this project I am tasked to create smart contract that implements the require(), assert() and revert() statements.

## Getting Started

### Executing program

To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/).

Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., HelloWorld.sol). Copy and paste the code into the file.
