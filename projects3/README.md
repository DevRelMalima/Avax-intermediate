# AVAX-Intermediate-Projects3

This is the third project in AVAX-Intermediate, in this project I am tasked to create a smart contract to create my own token on a local HardHat network. Once I have created the contract, I should be able to use remix to interact with it. From remix, the contract owner should be able to mint tokens to a provided address. Any user should be able to burn and transfer tokens.

## Getting Started

### Requirement

- Remix IDE
- Hardhat

### Executing program

#### Remix IDE

To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/).

Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., HelloWorld.sol). Copy and paste the code into the file.

#### Hardhat

Download the codes by downloading the entire repository which will give you access to other contencts of the repository.In the project directory,  run:

```shell

 npm install

```

After installing the dependences, run the test file by using the following command:

```shell
npx hardhat test
```
