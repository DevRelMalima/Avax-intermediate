# AVAX Token Intermediate projects 3

This is the third project in AVAX-Intermediate, in this project I am tasked to create a smart contract to create my own token on a local HardHat network. Once I have created the contract, I should be able to use remix to interact with it. From remix, the contract owner should be able to mint tokens to a provided address. Any user should be able to burn and transfer tokens.

## Getting Started

### Requirement

- Remix IDE
- Hardhat

### Executing program

#### Remix IDE

To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/).

Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., HelloWorld.sol). Copy and paste the code into the file.

# Requirements:
1. MetaMask extension installed in your web browser.

#Getting Started:

1. Clone the Repository:
   Download the entire repository from GitHub to access all the project contents.

2. Install Dependencies:
   In the project directory, open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install the required dependencies using npm:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Start Local Hardhat Node:
   After installing the dependencies, run the following command to start the local Hardhat node:

   ```
   npx hardhat node
   ```

4. Deploy the Contract:
   Open a second terminal and deploy the contract on the local Hardhat node using the following command:

   ```
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
   ```
